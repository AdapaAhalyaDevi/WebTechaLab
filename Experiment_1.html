<h4>The Gingerbreadman Story</h4>
<p>This Is a short Gingerbreadman Story. Long ago there lived an old couple. One day the old couple. One day the old woman cooked a gingerbread cookie in the shape of a man. As soon as the gingerbread man was cooked, he jumped out of the tin and ran out of the open window, shouting, "Don't eat me!" He ran away as fast as he could.</p>
<p>The old couple tried to chase the gingerbread man but he was too fast for them. Soon a hungry pig saw the gingerbread man and said, "Stop! I would like to eat you." He too joined the chase. The gingerbread man was too fast and said, "You can't catch me! I am the Gingerbread Man."</p>
<p>A little further, a hungry cow saw the gingerbread man and said, "Stop! I would like to eat you." She too joined the chase. "You can't catch me! I am the Gingerbread Man," said the ginger bread man.</p>
<p>Next, he met a horse. The horse too joined the chase. Finally, the gingerbread man came to a river and stopped as the river could make him soggy. A clever fox came by and wanted to eat him up but he preten ded to be nice and offered help to the gingerbread man. He asked the gingerbread man to climb on his head so that he could take him across the river. The gingerbread man was so scared of water that he agreed.</p>
<p>As soon as they reach the other side, the fox tossed up the gingerbread man in the air. He opened his mouth and ate him up. That was the end of the Gingerbread man.</p>
